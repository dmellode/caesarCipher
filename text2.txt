Hello, hello, I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me, 'cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello, last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade, and it made me feel young
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up it made me numb, and I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids they got drunk, and I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
How's it go again?
"Goodbye, goodbye, " I said to my bestest buds
We said that we'd keep in touch, and we did our best
All my new friends, we smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile at anything else
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up it made me numb, and I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All theâ€¦
